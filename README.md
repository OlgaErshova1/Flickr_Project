# Flickr Project

This project was designed to practice the following skills:

•	Use the Volley library to make an HTTP request and handle the JSON response.

•	Parse the JSON response to create objects or model classes that represent the data received from the API

•	Create a custom layout for each item in the RecyclerView using a custom adapter

•	Configure the RecyclerView to use a grid layout manager to display images in a grid pattern

•	Load and display images in the RecyclerView using a Picasso library

•	Search and present images by selected topic

•	Bind image data to the ImageView in the RecyclerView adapter

•	Pass relevant data (e.g., image URL, metadata) to the detail page and display it

•	Implement a long-click listener in the RecyclerView adapter to display a larger version of the image in a dialog or another view

•	Use a local database such as SQLite to store data retrieved from the API
